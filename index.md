title: Where I'm at.

Whats good good people? This is the first attempt at something like this.
It's kinda crazy because, If you had asked me 2 years ago where I would be in 2 years. I would have never guessed that I would be in the position that I am in.

Honestly, I have just finally learned the beginner course for c++ and before that I learned python, talk about a complete difference between high level and low level languages. I threw me for a complete loop when I started with c++ for school. Yet, the functions, loops, and classes were all familiar, just in different syntax.

So now my goal is to learn the appropriate way to develop and deploy a application, but I think I might start small with a browser extension, not sure. 
Maybe smaller starting is better, but when I finally learned to swim, I was all too excited to jump out into the deep end off the diving board, I almost drowned a few times until I really got the hang of it, but maybe this is like that, maybe it isn't. I won't know until I try though.
